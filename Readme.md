## 1. Project Title

**Proof-of-Attendance ZK Badge â€“ Privacy-Preserving Attendance Tracking**

---

## 2. Project Description

This smart contract enables issuing **proof-of-attendance badges** using **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** to ensure that participation can be verified without revealing personal or sensitive details.
The concept is simple: attendees receive a badge linked to their wallet, and this badge serves as cryptographic evidence of their participation in an event, training, or community activity.

---

## 3. Project Vision

To build a **trustless, privacy-focused attendance verification system** that:

* Works seamlessly across decentralized applications.
* Ensures proof of participation without exposing user identities.
* Supports interoperability with NFT marketplaces and on-chain identity solutions.

---

## 4. Future Scope

* Integrate real zero-knowledge proof verification using off-chain computation and on-chain verification keys.
* Support **event-specific badges** with metadata (event name, date, type).
* Make badges **transferable or soulbound** depending on use case.
* Add **time-limited proof validity** for seasonal or limited events.
* Connect with DAO voting systems where attendance badges give governance rights.
